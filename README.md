# TODO: Name the game

## Game Mechanics
The idea of the game is simple. It is a 2 dimensional side scroller that doesnâ€™t have an end goal other than rack up as many points as you can. The game will be set to constantly move towards the left (think older Mario games) so you have to make quick decisions to keep racking up your score. Enemies will attack from left, right, and up. Accordingly your character will be able to attack in these directions as well.  A good example of this are games such as contra or older NES games. There will be obstacles that get in the way as the level progresses. These will require you to jump over them. Jump and up attack will be the same move. The user will not be able to freely move the character about the board, but only choose the direction of attack.The idea is to keep the game as simple as possible, so as to be able to play with one hand. The most popular games on the market and ones that have great impacts such as Flappy bird all allow the user to control the game with one hand. We will eventually allow leaderboards and other enhancements. The game will be free on the market with advertisement or an ad free version for $1.

### Level Design
- 2D side scroller
- Infinite randomly generated levels
- Holiday/event themes

### Character Design
- There will be one character for now. We can add more as we see fit
- Possibly add character skills and attacks
- We want the main character to be as silly as possible in order to draw attention

### Art direction
- Simple
  - Very simple graphics (think Flappy bird)
  - This does not mean ugly.  The game will still be aesthetically pleasing in accordance with its gameplay.
- Stylized
  - If we go this route, we should look into games such as Okami, world of goo, etc.
  - This will be the more difficult route, but might be more appreciated.

### Control scheme
- Up: Attack | Jump
- Left: Attack left
- Right: Attack forward
